# Formatter 
- Hi it is just a simple C formatter ,which remove the comment(both multiline and singleline comment)
- I just try to build combined tool , which can do things nicely in one command
- Biggest challenges for me was  the extra newline remover , i had made that over complicated , then i take some help and debug that many time 
and reduce that to just 3 conditional thing which can manage the extra newline removal easily without breaking the code mostly*

- It is my side project to learn this language in depth , OG book K&R
